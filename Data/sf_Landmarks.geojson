Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin were both internationally known lesbian-rights activists with deep roots in the LGBTQ civil rights movement and were also the first same-sex couple to be married in San Francisco in 2004 and in 2008. Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon were one of the four couples that founded the Daughters of Bilitis in San Francisco and they often hosted DOB parties and fundraising events in their home during the early years of the organization, when it was a secret group. The first national lesbian-rights organization in the United States, Daughters of Bilitis (DOB), was initially organized as a social group where lesbians could meet and socialize. The organization soon added a newsletter, The Ladder, which became an internationally known magazine, and then to develop a network of local chapters and public biennial conventions on issues of importance to lesbians and gay men. 651 Duncan Street was Lyon’s and Martin’s residence and the place that is most representative of their productive lives as activists, organizers, writers, educators, and icons. As outlined in Citywide Historic Context Statement for LGBTQ History in San Francisco, the Lyon-Martin House is associated with significant events and persons under Theme 4: Homophile Movements (1950s to 1960s). The Daughters of Bilitis, Phyllis Lyon, Del Martin, and “…their home in San Francisco’s Noe Valley neighborhood” are also discussed in the National Park Service’s LGBT America, A Theme Study of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer History.","culturalsum":"Landmark is associated with a social, ethnic, or cultural group","context":"Great Constructions;

Established during a time of rampant discrimination against Asian immigrants, the business functioned as a point of contact for newly arrived Japanese men and their families.","culturalsum":"Landmark is associated with a social, ethnic, or cultural group","context":"Great Constructions; Private and Public Institutional, Health and Medicine; Japanese HCS; Gilded Age Styles, Richardsonian Romanesque; Late 19th & Early 20th Century Revival Styles, Renaissance Revival","idencultural":"Japanese","objectid":"60","rbrp":null,"crit2":"Y","largephoto":"https://sfplanninggis.org/Preservation/Landmarks/Large/246.jpg","status":"Adopted","sigsum":"Associated with historic events; Associated with individuals important to local, state, or national history; Significant for architecture or design or is the work of a master","desage":"98","sigperson":"Matsunosuke Tsukamoto; James Lick","proptype":"Commercial","address":"165 10th Street","crit1":"Y","thumbail":"http://sfplanninggis.org/Preservation/Landmarks/Docs/246.jpg","archbuild":"Wright & Sanders Architects","legbus":null,"yeardes":"2004","pimlink":"https://sfplanninggis.org/pim?search=3509/014"},"geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-122.414733897851,37.774491162837],[-122.414919381224,37.774639111206],[-122.414636485086,37.774862527084],[-122.414451001712,37.774714581413],[-122.414733897851,37.774491162837]]]]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"potcultural":"Jewish","crit3txt":"Significant for architecture or design or is the work of a master","cultural_1":"Y","name":"Haas-Lilienthal House","crit2txt":null,"potcontext":"Jewish","landmarkno":"69","culturaldist":null,"crit1txt":null,"doccontext":null,"ntlreg":"Yes","crit3":"Y","yearbuilt":"1885","style":"Queen Anne","desdoc":"https://sfplanninggis.org/docs/landmarks_and_districts/LM69.pdf","description":"Designed by architect Peter R.

Miller and Timothy L. Pflueger in 1923. The exterior of this monumental banking hall is designed in the Neoclassical style featuring sculpted Greek and Roman-inspired terra cotta ornamentation, fluted columns, a tympanum decorated with figures in relief, and oversized acroteria along its roofline. In its prime, the building was equipped with modern features such as public telephones and was linked to financial centers across the country by private telegraph wires. The building was originally occupied by the Stock Exchange, the nation’s first exchange that specialized in mining stocks. A product of the city’s booming 1920s stock market, the exchange was instrumental in making San Francisco the financial center of the West. In 1927, the name was changed to the Mining Exchange; by 1928 the building was occupied by the Curb Exchange, a securities trading exchange that operated until 1938.","culturalsum":null,"context":"Great Constructions; Commercial, Downtown Core, Merchants & Leaders; Late 19th/ Early 20th C.

Constructed largely to house itinerant and seasonal workers employed in nearby factories and industries along the waterfront, the hotel is emblematic of a pattern of the development in South of Market that began in the mid‐1800s and continued through the post‐1906 earthquake and fire reconstruction. The hotel is particularly notable for surviving the large‐scale redevelopment of South of Market during the mid-twentieth century during which much of the building stock, including nearly all the residential hotels, dating to the period when the neighborhood served as the city’s industrial and manufacturing center was razed. With its ornate millwork, rounded and angled bays, the Hotel Utah is also a striking example of Edwardian style architecture commonly employed in the design of residential hotel buildings constructed during the period.","culturalsum":null,"context":"Reconstruction Era; Commercial, Downtown Core, Hotels; Events that Shaped the City, 1906 Earthquake and Reconstruction; Industrial, Labor History, Leaders, & Union Halls; Late 19th & Early 20th Century Revival Styles, Classical Revival","idencultural":null,"objectid":"76","rbrp":null,"crit2":"N","largephoto":"https://sfplanninggis.org/Preservation/Landmarks/Large/282.jpg","status":"Adopted","sigsum":"Associated with historic events; Significant for architecture or design or is the work of a master","desage":"110","sigperson":null,"proptype":"Commercial","address":"500-504 4th Street","crit1":"Y","thumbail":"http://sfplanninggis.org/Preservation/Landmarks/Docs/282.jpg","archbuild":null,"legbus":null,"yeardes":"2018","pimlink":"https://sfplanninggis.org/pim?search=3777/001"},"geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-122.398195584858,37.779188574593],[-122.398263598786,37.779242726371],[-122.398066773163,37.779397213711],[-122.397998758336,37.779343062832],[-122.398195584858,37.779188574593]]]]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"potcultural":null,"crit3txt":"Significant for architecture or design or is the work of a master","cultural_1":"N","name":"Frank M.

The “History of Medicine in California” frescoes consist of 12 panels (10 pictorial and 2 descriptive) depicting California medical history with vivid, diverse images of doctors, lab scientists, and other medical professionals, and of suffering and recovered patients. The mural cycle “The History of Medicine in California” is significant as an excellent example of New Deal-era mural artwork, displaying the distinctive characteristics of New Deal-era frescos with a consistent earth-toned palette, intense saturated colors, figurative content, rounded forms, and overall stylistic influence of the Mexican mural movement of the 1920s. “History of Medicine in California” is also significant as the work of by master artist and muralist, Bernard Zakheim. The “History of Medicine in California” is the largest, most immersive fresco buono work of Zakheim’s career and the last fresco commission the artist completed in San Francisco. The period of significance for the “History of Medicine in California” frescoes is 1936-1938.","culturalsum":"Landmark is associated with a social, ethnic, or cultural group","context":"Great

Constructed in 1931‐1932, the building represents the work of two master architects, Martin J. Rist and Alfred I. Coffey, both separately and in partnership were well known for their designs of institutional buildings, such as schools and hospitals. The University Mound Old Ladies' Home was founded in 1884 with a $100,000 bequest from James Lick, one of the wealthiest men in California at that time. It originally sat on 25 acres of land which was farmed to provide food for the elderly women of modest means who lived there. The University Mound Old Ladies' Home was in operation for 130 years until 2014 when it was sold to a new nursing home provider.","culturalsum":null,"context":"Great Constructions; Private and Public Institutional, Health and Medicine; Late 19th and Early 20th Century Styles, Colonial Revival","idencultural":null,"objectid":"5","rbrp":null,"crit2":"N","largephoto":"https://sfplanninggis.org/Preservation/Landmarks/Large/269.jpg","status":"Adopted","sigsum":"Significant for architecture or design or is the work of a master","desage":"85","sigperson":null,"proptype":"Institutional","address":"350 University Street","crit1":"N","thumbail":"http://sfplanninggis.org/Preservation/Landmarks/Docs/269.jpg","archbuild":"Martin J.

Theodore Roosevelt Middle School is significant for its association with master architect Timothy Pflueger, one of the most talented and influential architects to have worked in San Francisco during the first half of the twentieth century.

The building is clearly identifiable as a James Dunn building, especially with its intricately molded balcony topped by an elaborate wrought iron railing – a feature that Dunn frequently used in his apartment building designs.","culturalsum":null,"context":"Gold Rush to Earthquake; Residential, Streetcar Suburbanization; Late 19th and Early 20th Century Revival Styles, Beaux Arts","idencultural":null,"objectid":"48","rbrp":null,"crit2":"N","largephoto":"https://sfplanninggis.org/Preservation/Landmarks/Large/276.jpg","status":"Adopted","sigsum":"Associated with historic events; Significant for architecture or design or is the work of a master","desage":"117","sigperson":null,"proptype":"Residential - SF","address":"2731-2735 Folsom Street","crit1":"Y","thumbail":"http://sfplanninggis.org/Preservation/Landmarks/Docs/276.jpg","archbuild":"James Francis Dunn","legbus":null,"yeardes":"2017","pimlink":"https://sfplanninggis.org/pim?search=3640/031"},"geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-122.414037667904,37.753595588666],[-122.413619634239,37.753668268276],[-122.413616535175,37.753635541048],[-122.413607116575,37.753536129089],[-122.414029370759,37.753507984806],[-122.414037667904,37.753595588666]]]]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"potcultural":null,"crit3txt":null,"cultural_1":null,"name":"Alcoa Building","crit2txt":null,"potcontext":null,"landmarkno":null,"culturaldist":null,"crit1txt":null,"doccontext":null,"ntlreg":null,"crit3":null,"yearbuilt":null,"style":null,"desdoc":null,"description":"Coming Soon!","culturalsum":null,"context":null,"idencultural":null,"objectid":"297","rbrp":null,"crit2":null,"largephoto":null,"status":"Work Program","sigsum":null,"desage":null,"sigperson":null,"proptype":null,"address":"300 CLAY ST","crit1":null,"thumbail":null,"archbuild":null,"legbus":null,"yeardes":null,"pimlink":null},"geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-122.399373679651,37.795251582395],[-122.399392775856,37.795345584032],[-122.399368856587,37.795348633633],[-122.399463994967,37.795816959185],[-122.399487914236,37.795813909584],[-122.39950701044,37.795907911221],[-122.39907986934,37.795962350782],[-122.399060774035,37.795868349145],[-122.399084693304,37.795865300443],[-122.398989555823,37.795396964998],[-122.398965635655,37.7954000128],[-122.39894654035,37.795306011164],[-122.399373679651,37.795251582395]]]]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"potcultural":null,"crit3txt":"Significant for architecture or design or is the work of a master","cultural_1":"N","name":"PG&E Old Station J","crit2txt":null,"potcontext":null,"landmarkno":"142","culturaldist":null,"crit1txt":"Associated with historic events","doccontext":null,"ntlreg":"Yes","crit3":"Y","yearbuilt":"1914","style":"Renaissance","desdoc":"https://sfplanninggis.org/docs/landmarks_and_districts/LM142.pdf","description":"Coming Soon!","culturalsum":null,"context":"Great Constructions: Government & Infrastructure, Water & Power; Late 19th & Early 20th Century Revivals, Classical Revival","idencultural":null,"objectid":"288","rbrp":null,"crit2":"N","largephoto":"https://sfplanninggis.org/Preservation/Landmarks/Large/142.jpg","status":"Adopted","sigsum":"Associated with historic events; Significant for architecture or design or is the work of a master","desage":"67","sigperson":null,"proptype":"Industrial","address":"565-569 Commercial Street","crit1":"Y","thumbail":"http://sfplanninggis.org/Preservation/Landmarks/Docs/142.jpg","archbuild":"Frederick H.

Its interior houses Reverend Roland Gordon’s monumental collage-mural, The Great Cloud of Witnesses, which documents the church and community at large, along with local, national, and international Black history. A work in progress since 1980, it has become the largest mural of its kind in the United States and serves as an unparalleled visual record of African-American religion, culture and history. With its tripartite composition, symmetrically composed façade, dentiled cornice, and centrally located, full-height portico capped with a pediment and supported by Ionic columns and pilasters, the Ingleside Presbyterian Church illustrates the distinctive characteristics of the Neoclassical style as designed by master Architect Joseph Leonard. The interior of the church houses  a collage-mural entitled The Great Cloud of Witnesses, which consists of newspaper and magazine clippings, posters, framed prints, and painted murals that have been pasted to the walls of all three levels. What began as Reverend Gordon's simple mission to provide images of role models to the community's youth has resulted in an awe-inspiring Folk Artist Environment that greatly contributes to the body of American and African American Folk Art and serves as an extraordinary, unparalleled visual documentation of national and San-Francisco-specific African American history.","culturalsum":"Landmark is associated with a social, ethnic, or cultural group","context":"Great Constructions; Artistic Expression, Murals; Private and Public Institutional, Houses of Spirituality, Christian; African-American HCS; Late 18th and Early 19th Century Styles, Neo-Classical","idencultural":"African American","objectid":"42","rbrp":null,"crit2":"N","largephoto":"https://sfplanninggis.org/Preservation/Landmarks/Large/273.jpg","status":"Adopted","sigsum":"Significant for architecture or design or is the work of a master","desage":"93","sigperson":"Joseph Leonard and Reverend Roland Gordon","proptype":"Religious","address":"1345 Ocean Avenue","crit1":"N","thumbail":"http://sfplanninggis.org/Preservation/Landmarks/Docs/273.jpg","archbuild":"Joseph Leonard","legbus":null,"yeardes":"2016","pimlink":"https://sfplanninggis.org/pim?search=6942/050"},"geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-122.457046624202,37.723642508695],[-122.457047617054,37.72396381308],[-122.456701644265,37.723894644422],[-122.456700869949,37.723643578888],[-122.457046624202,37.723642508695]]]]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"potcultural":null,"crit3txt":"Significant for architecture or design or is the work of a master","cultural_1":"N","name":"McLaren Lodge","crit2txt":"Associated with individuals important to local, state, or national history","potcontext":null,"landmarkno":"175","culturaldist":null,"crit1txt":"Associated with historic events","doccontext":null,"ntlreg":"Yes - Part of Golden Gate Park","crit3":"Y","yearbuilt":"1896","style":"Richardsonian\nRenaissance","desdoc":"https://sfplanninggis.org/docs/landmarks_and_districts/LM175.pdf","description":"Coming Soon!","culturalsum":null,"context":"Gold Rush to Earthquake: Government & Infrastructure, Parks & Recreation; Landscapes, Designed, Historic, Cultural; Late 19th/Early 20th C.

With a barrier‐free first floor level, the Sunshine School anticipated by decades the passage of the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) of 1968 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990.

Third Baptist Church has played an important role in promoting black community leadership as well as the social, economic, and political advancement of African Americans in San Francisco. Reverend Frederick Douglas Haynes Sr., emerged as a highly influential leader in San Francisco's civil rights movement and in 1945 was the first African American to run for a position on the Board of Supervisors. Although he never held office, in 1996, the subsequent pastor of Third Baptist Church, Reverend Dr. Amos C. Brown, became the city's second African American member of the Board of Supervisors. The property at 1399 McAllister Street is among several African American protestant churches constructed in San Francisco during the postwar period and one of the first churches in the city to brake from the traditional representations of ecclesiastical design with a new, simplified architectural expression that was thought to better articulate Protestant beliefs.","culturalsum":"Landmark is associated with a social, ethnic, or cultural group","context":"WWII and the Postwar City; Private and Public Institutional, Houses of Spirituality, Christian; African-American; Modern Architecture HCS, Midecentury Modern","idencultural":"African American","objectid":"71","rbrp":null,"crit2":"Y","largephoto":"https://sfplanninggis.org/Preservation/Landmarks/Large/275.jpg","status":"Adopted","sigsum":"Associated with historic events; Associated with individuals important to local, state, or national history; Significant for architecture or design or is the work of a master","desage":"65","sigperson":"Reverend Frederick Douglas Haynes, Sr.","proptype":"Religious","address":"1399 McAllister Street","crit1":"Y","thumbail":"http://sfplanninggis.org/Preservation/Landmarks/Docs/275.jpg","archbuild":"William F.

The building is also significant for its association with the African American civil rights movement, as the building served as the San Francisco chapter of the Committee on Racial Equality (CORE) and was the site of numerous meetings, events, trainings, and gatherings organized to advance the civil rights of African Americans during the 1942-1959 tenancy of the American Friends Service Committee. The building is further significant for its association with the advancement of LGBTQ rights, as the building was the center of civil rights leader Bayard Rustin’s organizing work early in his career ,and was the site of pioneering LGBTQ organization the Mattachine Society’s first convention in 1954. Lastly, 1830 Sutter Street is architecturally significant as the work of master architect Julia Morgan.  ","culturalsum":"Landmark is associated with a social, ethnic, or cultural group","context":"Great Constructions;

Goldberg Building is significant as an early 20th century mixed-use building designed with Classically-inspired ornament and containing extraordinarily rare, intact storefronts. On its upper floors, the building features rusticated stucco cladding, bay windows flanked by pilaster panels, molded window surrounds with keystones, and a bracketed cornice and shaped parapet. The ground floor contains three historic storefronts displaying a remarkable state of preservation, including original bulkheads, display windows, vestibule paving, doors, and transom. The storefronts rank among the best preserved storefronts of their age. The property is also significant as the work of master architect, Bernard J. Joseph. The building is named after the Pulitzer-Prize winning cartoonist, sculptor, and author Rueben (Rube) Garnett Lucius Goldberg, and served as Goldberg's San Francisco residence and studio.","culturalsum":"Landmark is associated with a social, ethnic, or cultural group","context":"Reconstruction Era; Important People; Jewish HCSLate 19th & Early 20th Century Styles, Classical Revival","idencultural":null,"objectid":"38","rbrp":"Further research needed on individuals discussed.","crit2":"Y","largephoto":"https://sfplanninggis.org/Preservation/Landmarks/Large/268.jpg","status":"Adopted","sigsum":"Associated with individuals important to local, state, or national history; Significant for architecture or design or is the work of a master","desage":"104","sigperson":"Rueben (Rube) Garret Lucius Goldberg; Max Goldberg","proptype":"Mixed-Use\nResidential","address":"182-198 Gough Street","crit1":"N","thumbail":"http://sfplanninggis.org/Preservation/Landmarks/Docs/268.jpg","archbuild":"Bernard J.

The stepped, 150‐foot tower, originally capped by an aircraft beacon, soars above the surrounding district. Named El Rey – \"The King\" in Spanish – the former theater, which was most recently used as a church, continues to be the neighborhood's foremost visual landmark. Timothy Pflueger, the architect of El Rey, is one of San Francisco's top architects of the twentieth century. El Rey is one of only three theaters in the city that retains its original Pflueger designed auditorium. Built to serve the new residence parks and streetcar suburbs of the fast‐growing West of Twin Peaks area, El Rey was perhaps the grandest of all the so‐called \"neighborhood theaters\" that proliferated along major commercial corridors in the city's outlying neighborhoods between the First and Second World Wars.","culturalsum":"Landmark is associated with a social, ethnic, or cultural

The house embodies many characteristics of the Italianate villa type, including its portico, tower, cross-gable roof, bracketed cornice, fluted door and window trim, and segmental-arched windows with bracketed hoods. In contrast to the much more common Italianate rowhouse which usually has only one ornamented façade, there is Italianate detailing on three of its four exterior elevations, indicating that it was meant to be appreciated within its landscaped garden setting unobscured by adjoining buildings.
